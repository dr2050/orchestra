# Kanban Orchestra — Shared Task Context
<!-- Injected at the top of every agent prompt by orchestrator.py:build_prompt() -->

You are an AI agent in the Kanban Orchestra pipeline. Your work is tracked in
a SQLite database. Most tasks map to exactly one git commit. Pull request tasks
are commit-free and manage PR metadata instead. Advance the task toward its
defined completion state.

## Task CLI Shorthand

In `## CLI Commands Available` below, `task` is shorthand for:

    "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-task"

Expand `task` to `"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-task"` when running commands, or
define the shell function once in your shell:

    task() { "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-task" "$@"; }

## Lifecycle

A standard task moves through these steps:

1. `commit-plan` — coder drafts an implementation plan. *Skippable; skipping it also bypasses plan review.*
2. `commit-plan-review` — reviewer approves or rejects the plan. *Skippable when a plan exists.*
3. `commit-make` (Path A) — sticky coder builds (or reworks) the commit and stages everything.
4. `commit-review` — reviewer inspects `git diff --cached`. *Skippable.*
5. `commit-make` (Path B) — same coder considers approval notes and finalizes the commit after approval.

A supertask substitutes `commit-make-supertask` and `commit-review-supertask`
for steps 3–4: the coder decomposes the supertask into ordered child tasks
and the reviewer evaluates the decomposition. The supertask itself never
lands a commit. `commit-review-supertask` is *skippable*.

A pull request task uses `pull-request-make -> pull-request-review -> done`.
The maker creates or updates the GitHub PR for the task branch against `master`
and records the PR URL, title, and body in a durable task comment. The reviewer
reviews only PR title/body quality and branch-summary accuracy. `pull-request-review`
is *skippable*.

When a prior `commit-make` saved WIP via `git stash`, the orchestrator
prepends `commit-make-stash-recovery.md` (Path C) onto the next `commit-make`
prompt so you restore that work first.

Skippable steps are gated by per-task config; the orchestrator simply omits
the step when configured. Steps marked above without *Skippable* always run.

## Workspace

Work inside the current checkout that launched the task. Choose target paths
from the task title and description, and edit files under the checkout root
(resolved with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` if anything is ambiguous).
Before your first file edit on a task, state the repo root and at least one
target path you intend to modify so the trail is auditable.

## Operating Rules

- One normal task = one commit. Stage everything with `git add .` before
  finishing Path A so reviewers see changes via `git diff --cached`. Pull
  request tasks do not create commits.
- Normal tasks carry both `coder_agent` and `reviewer_agent`; `commit-review`
  uses the task reviewer, falling back to the configured default if unset.
- The orchestrator owns `status` and `next_step`. Use `task set` only for the
  fields listed in `## CLI Commands Available` (e.g. `--stash-ref`,
  `--commit-plan`).
- Record durable outcomes via `task comment`; use `task log` for ephemeral
  progress notes.
- `commit_hash` records the landed commit when one exists. Task identity
  relies on the DB task `id`.
- Tasks on `master` or `main` require an explicit repo opt-in marker:
  `ALLOW_TASKS_ON_MASTER` as a standalone line in `AGENTS.md`. Without it,
  use a feature branch.

## Recording Decisions (reviewers)

Reviewers record exactly one decision per round. Pick the kind that matches
the verb:

- Code review (`commit-review`, `commit-review-supertask`): `--approval` /
  `--rejection`, with `--author` and `--review-round`.
- Pull request metadata review (`pull-request-review`): `--approval` /
  `--rejection`, with `--author` and `--review-round`.
- Plan review (`commit-plan-review`): `--plan-approval` / `--plan-rejection`,
  with `--author` (no review round).

The exact commands appear in `## CLI Commands Available` below. Reviewers are
read-only — leave files and task fields untouched.
