# Orchestra

Orchestra is a local orchestration harness for AI-agent development workflows.
It coordinates work in a git repository through a SQLite-backed task queue,
prompt templates, shell wrappers, and a small dashboard.

The project is for developers who already run coding agents from local CLIs
and want a more structured loop around planning, implementation, review, and
one-task-one-commit delivery. Orchestra does not provide hosted model access,
API keys, subscriptions, or accounts for Codex, Claude, Gemini, Kilo, or any
other model provider.

## What It Does

- Tracks development work in a local Kanban task database.
- Dispatches task prompts to configured agent CLIs on your machine.
- Supports separate coder and reviewer agents per task.
- Preserves review feedback and validation notes in task comments.
- Provides a local browser dashboard for queue and runtime visibility.
- Includes an older feature-phase workflow for larger planned efforts.

Orchestra is local-first tooling, not a hosted service. It assumes you are
comfortable with git, shell commands, and reviewing agent-generated changes.

## Core Concepts

**Orchestra checkout** is this repository. Set `ORCHESTRA_DIR` to its path and
put `bin/` on `PATH` to use the `ko-*` wrapper commands.

**Work repo** is the git repository where development happens. Kanban state is
stored in that repo as `kanban-orchestra.db`, with runtime files under
`.kanban-orchestra/`.

**Agent CLIs** are external commands configured in
`shared_scripts/shared_config.py`. The default config includes examples for
`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, and `kilo`, but those binaries, logins, model
accounts, and billing arrangements are entirely user-provided.

**Task lifecycle** is usually:

```text
commit-plan -> commit-plan-review -> commit-make -> commit-review -> finalize
```

Planning and review steps can be skipped per task when a smaller workflow is
appropriate.

## Requirements

Required:

- macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like shell environment.
- Git.
- Python 3 with `venv` support.
- Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
- At least one configured agent CLI on `PATH` if you want the orchestrator to
  run tasks automatically.

Optional:

- A browser for the local dashboard.
- `gh` for GitHub-oriented helper workflows.
- Homebrew and the scripts in `shared_scripts/` if you want the author's
  preferred macOS helper tools.
- Additional document/media tools such as `pandoc` or `ffmpeg` only for
  workflows that explicitly use them.

## Setup

Clone the repo and build its checkout-local Python environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dr2050/orchestra.git
cd orchestra
./shared_scripts/bootstrap-python-env.sh
export ORCHESTRA_DIR="$PWD"
export PATH="$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin:$PATH"
```

For a shared machine, you can choose a stable shared checkout path instead:

```bash
export ORCHESTRA_DIR=/Users/Shared/orchestra
"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/shared_scripts/bootstrap-python-env.sh"
export PATH="$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin:$PATH"
```

That path is only an example. Any clone path works as long as `ORCHESTRA_DIR`
points at it.

## Configure Agent CLIs

Review `shared_scripts/shared_config.py` before running the orchestrator. It
maps agent names to command lines, for example:

- `codex` -> `codex exec ...`
- `claude`, `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus` -> `claude ...`
- `gemini` -> `gemini ...`
- `kilo` -> `kilo ...`

Install and authenticate only the CLIs you intend to use. If your available
agents differ from the defaults, either edit the shared config for your
machine or set task-level/default agent choices:

```bash
export ORCHESTRA_DEFAULT_CODER=codex
export ORCHESTRA_DEFAULT_REVIEWER=codex
```

You can also pass `--coder-agent` and `--reviewer-agent` when adding a task.

## Quickstart

Run these commands from a separate work repo, not from the Orchestra checkout:

```bash
cd /path/to/work-repo
ko-kanban
```

Create a small task on the current branch:

```bash
ko-task add "Improve README" \
  --description "Make the setup instructions clearer." \
  --branch "$(git branch --show-current)" \
  --skip commit-plan
```

Kanban tasks on `master` or `main` are disabled by default. Use a feature
branch for normal work. Repos that intentionally queue work on `master` or
`main` can opt in by adding `ALLOW_TASKS_ON_MASTER` as a standalone line in
their root `AGENTS.md`.

Inspect the queue, note the task ID, then mark the task ready:

```bash
ko-task list
ko-task set <task-id> --status ready
```

Start the orchestrator:

```bash
ko-orchestrator
```

In another terminal, start the dashboard:

```bash
ko-dashboard
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8427` to watch task state and orchestrator output.

The orchestrator expects a clean worktree before it starts. It will create,
stage, review, and finalize commits according to the task lifecycle and the
agents you configured.

## Common Commands

```bash
ko-task list
ko-task show <task-id>
ko-task show-comments <task-id>
ko-task log <task-id> "short progress note"
ko-task get-commit-footer <task-id>
ko-get-update
```

Feature-phase commands are still available for larger planned efforts:

```bash
ko-feature-orchestrator
ko-feature-dashboard
```

See [feature-phase-orchestration/README.md](feature-phase-orchestration/README.md)
for that older workflow.

## Testing

From the Orchestra checkout:

```bash
bin/ko-test
```

With no arguments, this runs the unit tests for the Kanban and feature-phase
orchestration scripts.

## Known Limitations

- This is local-first orchestration around local git checkouts and local agent
  CLIs. It is not multi-user infrastructure.
- Agent behavior depends on your installed CLI versions, local auth state,
  model access, and provider limits.
- Some helper scripts reflect macOS/Homebrew-oriented workflows.
- Task state is stored in SQLite files inside the work repo.
- The orchestrator intentionally refuses to start on a dirty worktree.
- The feature-phase pipeline predates the Kanban task queue and is less central
  to day-to-day use.
- This is a small open-source project extracted from personal tooling; expect
  rough edges and read diffs carefully.
