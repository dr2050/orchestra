# Orchestra

Orchestra coordinates the AI coding CLIs you already have installed —
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code),
[OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex),
[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) —
into an autonomous development team. You describe tasks in plain language;
Orchestra queues them, assigns one CLI to code and another to review, runs
rejection cycles on the staged diffs, and lands approved commits — while you
do something else.

## How It Works

Orchestra is a Python-based local task queue backed by SQLite. Each task is
scoped to one git commit. The orchestrator prompts a coding agent to make the
change, routes the diff through a review agent, and repeats until the reviewer
approves or the retry budget is exhausted. The approved commit is then
finalized on the branch.

The primary interface is your AI agent's **Kanban skill**, not a CLI you drive
by hand. You install the skill into your agent, then talk to it: *"Queue a
task to fix X."* The skill handles bootstrapping, task creation, status
checks, and all wrapper commands.

## Operator Visibility

Everything the orchestrator does is visible. The live dashboard shows active
tasks, ready and blocked queues, recent completions, and the orchestrator's own
heartbeat. This dashboard is the real repo-scoped status surface; the old
process-manager UI has been removed and is not a compatibility path. Each task
carries durable comments — reviewer feedback, validation results, commit
messages — so you can trace every decision without reading agent logs. Run logs
capture the full session, and CLI commands let you inspect or update any task
from another terminal or a remote agent session. If something stalls or fails,
you see it immediately and can intervene.

## Supported Agents

Orchestra shells out to local agent CLIs. It ships with built-in support for:

| Key | Agent CLI | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| `sonnet` / `claude` / `haiku` / `opus` | [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) | `sonnet` is the default coder and planner; `opus` is the default supertask planner |
| `codex` | [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | Default reviewer, plan reviewer, and supertask reviewer |
| `gemini` | [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | |
| `kilo` | [Kilo Code](https://kilocode.ai) | |

You can add or change agent commands in
`shared_scripts/shared_config.py`. Orchestra does not provide API keys,
accounts, or billing — install and authenticate each CLI yourself.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Git**
- **macOS or Linux** (Windows is untested)
- At least one supported agent CLI installed and authenticated

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/confusionstudios/orchestra.git /path/to/orchestra
   ```

2. **Set `ORCHESTRA_DIR`** in your shell startup file (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, or
   equivalent):

   ```bash
   export ORCHESTRA_DIR="/path/to/orchestra"
   ```

   zsh users can also load the optional command helpers:

   ```zsh
   source "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/shell/orchestra.zsh"
   ```

3. **Bootstrap the Python environment:**

   ```bash
   "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/shared_scripts/bootstrap-python-env.sh"
   ```

4. **Sync skills into a work repo:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/work-repo
   "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-sync-skills"
   ```

5. **Start the repo instance** from the work repo root and keep it running:

   ```bash
   "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-orchestrator"
   ```

   For first use, run it in a dedicated terminal. The important part is the
   launch directory: the orchestrator uses the current git repo as the work
   repo, stores state there, and starts the matching dashboard for that repo.

   Check status from another terminal or through the Kanban skill:

   ```bash
   "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-get-update"
   ```

   The dashboard is attached to that same repo instance. If you loaded the zsh
   helpers, `orchestra` starts the orchestrator/dashboard pair from the current
   repo root. `orchestra-dashboard` / `odash` opens only that per-repo
   dashboard; it does not start or replace the removed process-manager UI.

   For multiple repos, create a private fleet list:

   ```bash
   "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-fleet" init
   "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-fleet" add .
   "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-fleet" status
   "$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-fleet" start
   ```

   The fleet config is `~/.config/orchestra/fleet.repos`: one git repo root per
   line, with blank lines and `#` comments allowed.
   `ko-fleet stop`, `restart`, `attach`, `logs`, and `dashboard` operate on the
   selected repo label or path. `ko-fleet dashboard-open` is an explicit alias
   for opening the repo dashboard. The removed process-manager `BREAK` control
   has no remote replacement; stop or interrupt the repo instance, inspect with
   `ko-get-update`, update the affected task with `ko-task`, and restart
   explicitly.

6. **Talk to your agent.** In the work repo, invoke the Kanban skill with a
   plain-language request:

   > "Using the Kanban skill, queue a task to fix the broken pagination query."

   The skill handles the rest.

### Remote Control

The orchestrator runs continuously on your machine, polling for tasks and
dispatching local agents to do the work. You don't need to be at the terminal
to queue tasks. Use
[Claude Code Remote Control](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/remote-control),
[OpenAI Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex) from the ChatGPT app, or any agent
channel that reaches your machine — Discord bots, Telegram, whatever you wire
up. Say *"queue a task to refactor the auth middleware"* from your phone, and
the orchestrator picks it up.

From there, everything happens locally: agents write the code, other agents
review the diff, rejections loop back for another attempt, and approved commits
land on the branch — all while you're away from your desk.

### Running The Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the durable worker. Start it from the root of each work
repo where you want tasks processed, and keep it alive in whatever way you
normally keep local development processes alive. It starts the matching
dashboard for that same repo instance. The work repo owns the state
(`kanban-orchestra.db`, runtime files, dashboard metadata, and logs); the
Orchestra checkout only provides the tools.

For first use, run it directly in a dedicated terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/work-repo
"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-orchestrator"
```

Codex, Claude, or another agent can still be your operator interface: ask it to
queue tasks, check status, or open the dashboard when you need to inspect the
queue visually. It should not be the long-lived process host unless you are
doing a short experiment and are comfortable with the orchestrator stopping
when that session ends.

For several repo instances, use the fleet command:

```bash
"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-fleet" init
"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-fleet" add /path/to/work-repo
"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-fleet" precheck
"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-fleet" start
```

`ko-fleet` reads `~/.config/orchestra/fleet.repos`, a private flat list with
one repo root per line. It derives display names from each path. `start` is
all-or-nothing for selected repos: if any selected repo is dirty or invalid,
nothing launches.

### YOLO Mode and Hardening

Orchestra delegates work to local AI coding CLIs in their non-interactive
YOLO-style modes, where the agent can run shell commands without stopping for
per-command permission prompts. Those agent processes run as your local user.
If a prompt-injected or misbehaving agent decides to read, change, or
exfiltrate files, it can reach whatever that user account can reach: SSH keys,
GitHub credentials, browser state, other repos, private notes, and unrelated
project files.

You should always run Orchestra and the agent CLIs under a separate macOS user
account, an OrbStack/Docker container, or a `sandbox-exec` profile. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.

### Tips

* Orchestra will not launch against a dirty worktree. Commit or stash before
  starting.
* The agent running the Kanban skill should not modify the worktree itself —
  queued runs block if uncommitted changes appear between tasks.
* Set a task to `none` status while you're still editing it. Change it to
  `ready` when it should be picked up.
* The Kanban skill can adjust task details before launch: add/remove skipped
  steps, swap the coding or review agent, change retry limits. Ask it.

## Agent Configuration

Default agent roles can be overridden with environment variables. Set each one
to a key from `shared_scripts/shared_config.py`:

```bash
export ORCHESTRA_DEFAULT_CODER=sonnet
export ORCHESTRA_DEFAULT_REVIEWER=codex
export ORCHESTRA_DEFAULT_PLANNER=sonnet
export ORCHESTRA_DEFAULT_PLAN_REVIEWER=codex
export ORCHESTRA_DEFAULT_SUPER_PLANNER=opus
export ORCHESTRA_DEFAULT_SUPER_REVIEWER=codex
```

## Source Layout

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `AI-skills/` | Canonical skill instructions — `bin/ko-sync-skills` copies these into each agent's config directory |
| `kanban-orchestra/scripts/` | Task queue, dashboard, orchestrator, and CLI |
| `kanban-orchestra/prompts/` | Prompts injected into task agents |
| `bin/` | Thin wrappers that run through the checkout-local venv |
| `shared_scripts/` | Setup and helper scripts |

## Operating Model

Kanban state lives in the **work repo**, not in the Orchestra checkout:

- `kanban-orchestra.db` — task state (SQLite)
- `.kanban-orchestra/` — runtime files and logs
- Tasks target the work repo's current branch unless overridden

The orchestrator expects a clean worktree. It refuses to launch when dirty and
blocks rather than continuing through unexpected uncommitted changes.

## Policies

Orchestra is not a sandbox or permission boundary. Agent commands run as your
local user and can read or write any files available to that user. Run
Orchestra under a dedicated user account or container — see
[YOLO Mode and Hardening](#yolo-mode-and-hardening).

Automatic task execution requires non-interactive agent CLI modes. If an agent
needs a permission prompt for every command, queued work will not complete
reliably.

Tasks on `master` or `main` are blocked by default. To opt in, add
`ALLOW_TASKS_ON_MASTER` to the work repo's root `AGENTS.md`.

## Development

To work on Orchestra itself, skip the orchestration workflow and treat it as a
normal Python repo:

```bash
export ORCHESTRA_DIR="/path/to/orchestra"
"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/shared_scripts/bootstrap-python-env.sh"
"$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin/ko-test"
```
