Use Kanban Orchestra in the current working repo.

## Role check — read this first

Before doing anything else, determine which role applies:

| Role | How to tell | What to do |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Observer / operator** | Running ad-hoc, no orchestrator spawned you, or you are checking status for a user | Use `get-kanban-update` for status. Use `task list/show/add/set` for task management. |
| **Sticky coder** | The orchestrator explicitly spawned you as the designated build agent for a specific task | Follow the full workflow for that task. |

Default role: observer.

Do not infer agent choices from previous runs; leave agent flags unset and rely on configured defaults unless the user explicitly overrides them.

Kanban Orchestra is a local task orchestration system for AI agent work.
Tasks live in a SQLite database in the work repo, the orchestrator processes
`ready` tasks one at a time, each task carries its configured code reviewer
for `commit-review`, and the dashboard shows live state.

This file is the operational quickstart. The canonical spec lives at:

```text
$ORCHESTRA_DIR/tasks/kanban-orchestra-spec.md
```

Use the spec as the source of truth for task lifecycle, semantics, recovery,
and runtime behaviour. Use this file for bootstrap, paths, concrete CLI
commands, and quick stuck/not-stuck checks.

This skill requires `$ORCHESTRA_DIR` to point at the Orchestra installation
or checkout root. That installation provides the wrapper commands, including
`ko-kanban`, `ko-task`, `ko-dashboard`, and `ko-orchestrator`. For normal use,
put those wrappers on PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$ORCHESTRA_DIR/bin:$PATH"
```

## Task CLI shorthand

The CLI is exposed through the `ko-task` wrapper. Define `task` once in your shell:

```bash
alias task='ko-task'
```

All commands below use that shorthand. If you don't set the alias, use
`ko-task` directly.

## Workspace rule

Keep the Orchestra installation path distinct from the work repo path:
`$ORCHESTRA_DIR` is where the tooling lives, while the shell's current working
directory is the repository whose Kanban database, tasks, git diff, and runtime
state the wrappers operate on unless a command explicitly documents another
target.

Edit only files inside the current checkout root (paths like
`kanban-orchestra/...` and `AI-skills/...`). Treat files under
`$ORCHESTRA_DIR` as reference paths unless the user explicitly asks you to
edit there. Before your first edit, state the repo root
(`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) and at least one target path you plan to
modify under that root.

## Bootstrap

1. Treat the current working repo as the work repo.
2. Resolve the repo root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
3. Require `$ORCHESTRA_DIR`.
4. Remember the path split:
   - Current checkout / repo root: the work repo the wrappers operate on.
   - `$ORCHESTRA_DIR`: the Orchestra install that provides wrappers and
     reference implementation files.
5. Canonical paths:
   - DB: `<repo-root>/kanban-orchestra.db`
   - SQL dump: `<repo-root>/kanban-orchestra.sql`
   - Runtime dir: `<repo-root>/.kanban-orchestra/`
   - Orchestrator output: `<repo-root>/.kanban-orchestra/orchestrator.log`
   - Orchestra repo root: `$ORCHESTRA_DIR`
   - Kanban Orchestra root: `$ORCHESTRA_DIR/kanban-orchestra/`
   - Scripts: `$ORCHESTRA_DIR/kanban-orchestra/scripts/`
   - Prompts: `$ORCHESTRA_DIR/kanban-orchestra/prompts/`
6. Bootstrap the repo:
   ```bash
   ko-kanban
   ```
7. Report the resolved context: repo root, orchestra path, kanban orchestra
   root, DB path, orchestrator output path, and whether the DB was created
   or reused.

## Task lifecycle

A standard task moves through these steps:

1. `commit-plan` — coder drafts a plan. *Skippable* via `--skip commit-plan`
   on `task add` (or `task set --add-skip`).
2. `commit-plan-review` — reviewer assesses the plan. *Skippable.*
3. `commit-make` (Path A) — coder builds and stages the change. Always runs.
4. `commit-review` — reviewer inspects `git diff --cached`. *Skippable.*
5. `commit-make` (Path B) — same coder finalizes the commit after approval.
   Always runs.

Supertasks substitute `commit-make-supertask` and `commit-review-supertask`
for steps 3–4; the supertask itself never lands a commit.
`commit-review-supertask` is *skippable*.

When a prior `commit-make` saved WIP via `git stash`, the orchestrator
prepends Path C (`commit-make-stash-recovery.md`) to the next `commit-make`
prompt so the coder restores that work first.

Valid skip values: `commit-plan`, `commit-plan-review`, `commit-review`,
`commit-review-supertask`.

## Task management

All commands assume the `task` alias above.

```bash
task add "<title>" \
    [--description "<description-as-markdown>"] \
    [--branch <branch>] [--coder-agent <agent>] [--reviewer-agent <agent>] \
    [--kind <task|supertask>] [--parent <task-id>] \
    [--sequence-index <n>] [--skip <step>] [--allow-when-blocked]

task list [--status <status>] [--next-step <step>] [--branch <branch>] [--page <n>]
task show <task-id>
task show-comments <task-id>
task show-run-log <task-id>

task set <task-id> \
    [--status <status>] [--next-step <step>] [--branch <branch>] \
    [--description "<...>"] [--commit <hash>] [--coder-agent <agent>] [--reviewer-agent <agent>] \
    [--review-round <n>] [--last-review-decision <decision>] \
    [--commit-plan "<text>"] [--allow-when-blocked <bool>] \
    [--add-skip <step>] [--remove-skip <step>]

# Comments (use --message-stdin for multi-line / shell-sensitive text):
cat <<'EOF' | task comment <task-id> --message-stdin [--comment|--commit-message|--validation] [--author <name>]
<message>
EOF

cat <<'EOF' | task comment <task-id> --message-stdin [--approval|--rejection] --author <name> --review-round <n>
<message>
EOF

cat <<'EOF' | task comment <task-id> --message-stdin [--plan-approval|--plan-rejection] --author <name>
<message>
EOF

task log <task-id> "<message>"
```

## Process control

```bash
ko-orchestrator
ko-dashboard
ko-ui
```

When `ko-ui` is running, it supervises both the dashboard and orchestrator.
Use its local control path for operator actions instead of PID hunting:

```bash
ko-ui --orchestrator-control status
ko-ui --orchestrator-control start
ko-ui --orchestrator-control stop
ko-ui --orchestrator-control break
```

Control semantics:
- `status` reports the live `orchestra-ui` supervisor, supervised
  orchestrator process, dashboard process, and runtime row.
- `start` launches one supervised orchestrator and refuses duplicates. It
  also refuses to start while any task is still `status=running`; resolve the
  task manually or use `break` first.
- `stop` / pause stops the supervised orchestrator and recorded active agent
  children without changing task statuses, git state, staging, stash state, or
  worktree files. Use it when a human or agent needs to inspect or edit the
  repo exactly as-is.
- `break` is for wrong-task, wedged-run, or emergency interruption. It stops
  the supervised orchestrator and recorded active agent children, removes
  transient stop/control markers, clears stale runtime active-task fields, and
  parks an interrupted `status=running` task as `blocked` with a durable
  comment. It intentionally leaves git/worktree changes untouched.

Agents may use `stop` when asked to pause the supervised run or before a
manual inspection that must preserve state. Use `break` only when continuing
would make the task history less truthful or the run is wedged. After `break`,
inspect the blocked task and worktree before restarting.

Graceful stop after the current task finishes:

```bash
touch KANBAN_ORCHESTRATOR_STOP_AFTER_TASK
```

The graceful stop marker is separate from `stop`: the orchestrator detects it
at the top of the next polling loop after the current task finishes, logs the
detection, deletes the file, and exits.

Notes:
- `orchestrator.py` has no argument parser; running `--help` starts the loop.
- `dashboard.py` serves on `http://127.0.0.1:8427` by default.

## Default operating pattern

- `task add` to create tasks.
- `task list` and `task show` to inspect work.
- `task set` to move tasks between `none`, `ready`, `blocked`, and `done`.
- Before setting a task to `ready`, set `next_step` to a meaningful step
  (typically `commit-make`); tasks left at `next_step: none` get picked up
  and immediately dropped with no work executed.
- Use `--allow-when-blocked` for tasks that should stay runnable while
  another task is blocked.
- `task comment` for durable notes and review outcomes; `task log` for
  ephemeral progress notes.

## Important notes

- A task needs a branch and a meaningful `next_step` before it can be set
  to `ready`.
- Pass `--branch` explicitly when creating tasks; do not rely on prompts.
- `task comment --message-stdin` is the safe form for multi-line or
  shell-sensitive text.
- Code-review approvals/rejections (`--approval`, `--rejection`) require
  both `--author` and `--review-round`.
- Plan-review decisions (`--plan-approval`, `--plan-rejection`) require
  `--author` only.

## Stuck/not-stuck checks

First choice: the dashboard.

```bash
ko-dashboard
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8427
```

The overview page shows orchestrator status, the active task, reviewer
state, and current orchestrator output.

CLI-level state check via `orchestrator_runtime`:

```bash
sqlite3 kanban-orchestra.db "select status, current_task_id, current_step, current_branch, review_round, active_agents, status_message, last_heartbeat_at from orchestrator_runtime;"
```

Read the result like this:
- `status = running` with a fresh heartbeat usually means active work.
- `status = starting` means `orchestra-ui` accepted a start request and is
  launching the supervised orchestrator.
- `status = idle` with a fresh heartbeat means the orchestrator is healthy
  and waiting.
- `status_message` starting with `STALLED:` means the orchestrator is
  waiting for an agent ping acknowledgment and retries every 60 seconds.
- An old `last_heartbeat_at` means stale or dead.
- `status = stopped` means the supervised orchestrator was stopped or paused.
- `status = hard-break` means BREAK cleared stale active runtime fields; check
  the blocked task comment and worktree before restarting.
- `status = error` means an orchestrator-level failure.
- List blocked tasks with `task list --status blocked`.

When any task is `blocked`, only `ready` tasks with `allow_when_blocked`
enabled remain eligible for pickup.

Stay conversational with the user, but use these concrete commands when
operating the kanban system.
